WID
Seismic recordings of earthquakes can mathematically be represented as a times series of the convolution of the earthquake source function with the earth response function.
The object of deconvolution in seismology is simply to reverse the process of convolution by extracting the source mechanism (earthquake wave) from the recorded time series, leaving behind the earth response function, which reveals characteristic seismic properties of various discontinuities in the subsurface.
PdP and SdS functions are earth response functions that represent the underside reflection coefficients of deep earth discontinuities as precursors relative to the PP and SS phase reflected from the surface. 

WID - Wavefield Iterative Deconvolution is a technique that takes a source and signal time series and iteratively extracts deep earth discontinuities.

The output of WID is an inversion of the subsurface beneath the recorder of the signal.
